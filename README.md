- I DON'T LIKE JAX from TADC!! so I may hide some of y'all I'm sorry, but also not sorry.
 
- I do not like forsaken, Hazbin Hotel / Helluva Boss, I WILL hide you.
 
- I do not tolerate people being mean to me, it will result in a block, especially If I'm trying to be friendly. (this goes for people who approach me first)
 
- if you go by any proship stance. Personally uncomfortable about it but I won't harass you over it.

- If you harass other players or try to make a big thing about nothing. Pony Town is a game where you roleplay and socialize, y'all are lowkey too chronically online

- If you say doubles dni or anything like that, if you're REALLY that sensitive about it, hide me. don't make a whole ass deal about it, don't tell me to change my skin, don't send anyone after me. You are in charge of your own damn internet circle.
