-I DON'T LIKE JAX!! so I may hide some of y'all I'm sorry, but also not sorry.
 
-I do not like forsaken, Hazbin Hotel / Helluva Boss, I WILL hide you.
 
-I do not tolerate people being mean to me, it will result in a block, especially If I'm trying to be friendly. (this goes for people who approach me first)
 
-if you go by any proship stance. Personally uncomfortable about it but I won't harass you over it.

-If you harass other players or try to make a big thing about nothing. Pony Town is a game where you roleplay and socialize, y'all are lowkey too chronically online
